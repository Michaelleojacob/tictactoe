# How to use:<br>click the >Live application< link above, to open a new page. Once you are on the page, you may click to add an "X" marker to the page. If you click again an "O" should be placed. This pattern will repeat until there is a winner, or a tie. Then you may restart the game to play again.

# Built with:<br> vanilla javascript<br>html<br>css

# High Priority on:<br>Simple and sleek design<br>Mobile first focus<br>Dark mode

# Highlight features:<br>This was an exercise using modular organization in Javascript.<br>Features a IIFE, or immediately invoked function expression.<br>IIFE makes it so you can not "hack" the app by use of the console.<br>Code is organized and easy to read and use.<br>It's entertaining.

# Future additions:<br>Code refactor. I could clean up some parts, make it more modular and dry. (there is some repeating going on)<br>Adding a bot!
